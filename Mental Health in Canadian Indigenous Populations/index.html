        <h1>Exploring Mental Health in Canadian Indigenous Populations</h1>
    </head>
    <p>
        In this project, I used interactive visualizations to explore the proportion, location, and mental health relationships of three Canadian Indigenous populations: First Nations, Inuit, and Métis.  The data was modified from the <a href = "https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=9810028901">2021 Canadian Census</a> which contains the population counts for provinces and territories in Canada.  From this project, I learned how to create interactive donut, choropleth, and scatterplot visuals using the plotly and folium libraries in Python.

    <body>
        <b>What portion of Canadians identify as Indigenous?</b>

        <b>Where are Indigenous populations in Canada?</b>
        <iframe src = "images/map.html" class = "scalesvg"></iframe>
        <p>
            Indigenous populations are generally concentrated in the northern part of Canada with the majority concentrated in the Yukon territory, Northwest territory, and Nunavut areas with the Inuit group being the majority in the Nunavut area.
        </p>
        <p>
            The largest populations for the First Nations are in the southern areas of Canada with the largest being in Ontario and Quebec.  For the Inuit, the largest populations are in the northeastern areas of Canada with Nunavut and Quebec containing the majority.  And for the Métis, the largest populations are also in the southern areas of Canada with the largest being in Ontario and Alberta.

        <b>How does mental health relate to social/socioeconomic factors in Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations?</b>
        <iframe src = "images/scatter.html" class = "scalesvg"></iframe>
        <p>
            There seems to be higher percentages of self-assessed mental health fair/poor in the First Nations and Métis populations with both sexes in the First Nations having higher percentages than the Métis.  The non-Indigenous populations reveal to have the lowest percentages from the other populations.
        </p>
        <p>
            For food insecurity, the noticeable difference is that the Inuit population has the highest percentages for both sexes followed by the First Nations then the Métis with the non-Indigenous population having the lowest.
        </p>
        <p>
            A positive linear relationship can be seen between self-assessed mental health and food insecurity within the sexes plots where there is an increase in food insecurity percentage for every percentage increase in self-assessed mental health.  However, from each plot, the magnitudes of these relationships—correlation coefficients—differ between sex based on the slope that a fitted line would give when drawn between the points.  Females show to have a larger magnitude, where it looks strongly positively correlated, than males, where it looks to be weakly positively correlated.
